{{Template:Policy}}
=== <u>General</u> ===
#It is the responsibility of the members to come to amicable agreements of disputes over tools, space or other shop resources. 
#No sleeping / living in the space. (Napping for a little is okay.) 
#The Board of Directors will respond to all requests for approval within 48 hours unless the Board asks the requester for more time to decide. 

=== <u>Regular Meetings</u> ===
#Regular meetings of the members shall be held on the first and third Tuesdays of each month, at 7:30 PM.
#If the day fixed for a regular meeting falls on a legal holiday, such meeting shall be held at the same hour and place on the next business day.

=== <u>Safety</u> ===
#Safety is the top responsibility of every member and guest. 
#All members and guests are required to use appropriate personal protective equipment. i3Detroit provides eye, ear, hand, head, and respiratory protection of many kinds for this reason. 
#It is the the responsibility of every member and guest to understand the safe use of any tool or equipment before using it. 
#This understanding must be obeyed and any members or guests in the work area who may be affected must be made aware (such as a verbal request to put on safety equipment or relocate to avoid breathing fumes). 
#Members must not allow unsafe practices by any guest or other member. 

=== <u>Guests</u> ===
#Any member may host up to ten guests in the space. 
#Two or more members may host an unlimited number of guests. 
#In all cases, the member(s) hosting one or more guests are responsible for: 
##Verifying that each guest has a signed waiver on file before they're allowed entry 
##Signing the log with each guest 
##Making sure guests understand the guidelines under which we operate 
##The behavior and safety of the guest, in addition to the cleanliness and security of the space and its property.
#If any of the following are true, the person is not allowed in the space and must leave: 
##The person is not of the age of majority and a parent or guardian of the guest has not filled out the Young Guest Waiver on his or her behalf 
##The person is banned (see [[#Banning|10.1]]) 
#A member or guest who behaves inappropriately (including but not limited to violation of these rules or the bylaws) may be asked to leave by another member. In case of a dispute in the matter, any board member may mediate. The purpose of this policy is to remind us to "be excellent to each other." It may be difficult or uncomfortable to ask someone to change their behavior – please feel free to contact a Member Advocate or Board Member.

=== <u>Property</u> ===
==== Bringing Property to i3Detroit ====
# A list of property types are listed below. If property coming to i3Detroit meets one or more of these criteria, the associated process(es) must be followed. Otherwise the Board of Directors reserves the right to treat said property at i3Detroit as abandoned (see [[#Handling_Abandoned_Property_at_i3Detroit|5.8.1]]). 
#In all cases requiring approval, do not bring property to i3Detroit until it has been approved.
#The Board of Directors and the warden(s) of the zone receiving the property must both agree to the new property for it to be considered approved.

==== Oversize property ====
#Definition: The property is a standing object that occupies a floor footprint (like a server rack, table saw, furniture, or telescope) and it cannot be stored on a shelf. 
#Process: Give the Board or the appropriate zone's warden a filled-out [[media:Permit-table-final.pdf|Parking Permit]] and wait for approval. 
#Oversize projects coming to i3Detroit that will be removed in four days or less do not require approval from the Board of Directors.  The owner of the project must send a notification email to the discussion mailing list as described on the parking permit, and affix the completed permit to their property.

==== Donated property ====
#Definition: The property is brought to i3Detroit by a member or guest who wants i3Detroit to become the new owner of the property. 
#Process: Give the Board or the appropriate zone's warden a filled-out Donation Release and wait for approval. 

==== Shared property ====
#Definition: The property is brought to i3Detroit by a member (not a guest) who wants to share usage but not ownership of the property. The member retains ownership of the property. 
#Process: Give the Board or the appropriate zone's warden a filled-out [[media:EquipmentEntryForm.pdf|Equipment Entry Form / Ownership Affidavit]] and wait for approval.

==== Private property ====
#Definition: Property owned by a member that is not donated or shared. 
#Process: Members may freely bring private property to i3Detroit as long as it is stored safely in their plot. (see [[#Bringing_Property_to_i3Detroit|5.1]] and [[#Oversize_property|5.2]].) 

==== Integrating New Property into i3Detroit ====
#Shared, donated, and oversize property (referred here as “new property”) require special storage arrangements. If the property is to reside in the Large Project Parking area, the Board of Directors is responsible for making these arrangements. If the property is to reside in a wardened zone, that zone's warden may also coordinate.
#New property must be stored safely in an appropriate zone and with the approval of that zone’s warden. 
#New property must be labeled to identify it and where it should be stored. Shelves must be labeled with the property stored there. 
#Oversize, private property must have parking permit completed for it, filled out legibly and attached. 

==== Removing Property From i3Detroit ====
#Many members at i3Detroit depend on the availability of property and tools they do not own. All members are responsible for following these guidelines. 
#Members can freely remove property from the graveyard. 
#Members taking their personally-owned shared property out of i3Detroit must (amended: should) notify the member mailing list that the property is being removed. This is both a courtesy to others and a safeguard against apparent theft. 

==== Handling Abandoned Property at i3Detroit ====
#Because i3Detroit must actively defend itself from clutter and unwanted property, abandoned property is treated as though the owner places no value on the property and will not return to claim their property. In the interest of the members of i3Detroit and their need for a clean, safe workshop, the Board of Directors will thus use or dispose of the abandoned property however it sees fit. ([[Board Meeting Minutes 20141209#Abandoned_Property|2014-12-09 Board Meeting]])
#Property is considered abandoned if it meets at least one of the following criteria: 
##The property was never approved by the Board of Directors or the appropriate zone's warden when this approval was required (see [[#Bringing_Property_to_i3Detroit|5.1]]) 
##The property is neither shared nor donated, violates the safe storage rules, does not have a legible, valid [[media:I3ParkingPermit.pdf|Parking Permit]] attached, and has an attached [[media:I3ParkingTicket.pdf|Parking Ticket]] with an expired grace period 
##The property is in member storage and is either stored unsafely or exceeds the owning member’s plot 
##The property is owned by a former member and has not been collected within thirty days of that person’s departure from i3Detroit 
#Any member of i3Detroit can attach a Parking Ticket to property he or she suspects is abandoned (see [[#Parking_Tickets|5.9]]).

==== Parking Tickets ====
#The member affixing the [[media:I3ParkingTicket.pdf|Parking Ticket]] (the “finder”) to property he or she suspects is abandoned must undertake a goodwill effort to contact the owner of the property by sending an email meeting these criteria: 
##In the subject line, put the words “ABANDONED PROPERTY PARKING TICKET” 
##In the message, describe the property and where it was found 
##In the message, mention this notice and when it was attached 
##Send the message to i3detroit-announce@googlegroups.com 
##Immediately after the message passes moderation and is sent to the announcement list, a seven day grace period begins. If the owner has not stored the property correctly by 12:00 AM of the morning after the grace period expires, the property will be considered abandoned and disposed of accordingly (see [[#Handling_Abandoned_Property_at_i3Detroit|5.8.1]]).

====Lost and Found ====
#There will be designated by the Board at least one shelf called the "Lost And Found", not over shoulder high, that will be used for applicable items which have a Parking Ticket.
#After an item on a work surface has been ticketed, it may be moved carefully to the Lost And Found.
#Only the owner of the item may remove the item from the Lost And Found prior to expiration of the parking ticket. The Lost And Found is only for ticketed items.
#After a Member or Board meeting, any present Board member(s), any officer(s), or person(s) either designate, will go to the Lost And Found, review the tickets, and may dispose in any manner of any ticketed item(s) with an expired ticket.

=== <u>Storage</u> ===
==== Safe Storage ====
#All property at i3Detroit must be stored in a way that is safe and shows respect for members and guests in the space. Property that meets any of the following criteria will not be considered safely stored. 
##Property left on a work surface after the member or guest using it cannot be found and is presumed to have left 
##Property left on the floor, especially when it creates a trip hazard and/or obstructs a door or walkway 
##Property on a member storage shelf that protrudes more than 2” 
##Property on any shelf that protrudes more than 5” 
##Property left leaning against a wall, beam, or storage area 
##Property piled in front of a storage area 
==== Member Storage ====
#Each member is entitled to one “plot” in member storage, which is a defined, limited space for keeping his or her private property. 
#Each member must keep their private property in only one plot and not exceed the physical dimensions of that plot. The only exception is for approved oversize property. 
#Member property that is not stored safely or does not fit in the member’s plot is both dangerous and disrespectful and is considered abandoned (see [[#Handling_Abandoned_Property_at_i3Detroit|5.8.1]]). 
==== Parking Permits ==== 
#Once the Board of Directors or the appropriate zone's warden approves a piece of oversize property for storage at i3Detroit, the member owning the property attach the filled out [[media:Permit-table-final.pdf|Parking Permit]] to it. 
#The Parking Permit must indicate: Who owns the property; where at i3Detroit it is to be stored; the owner’s contact email address and/or phone number; the date when the Parking Permit expires; and the date the Board of Directors or the appropriate zone's warden approved the Parking Permit. 
#The oversize property must be stored in its designated spot at i3Detroit with the Parking Permit visibly affixed. Property must be removed by the time its parking permit expires.

=== <u>Floor Plan, Coordinators, and Zones </u> ===
#“Zones” are defined, limited areas of i3Detroit’s space that are set aside for a particular purpose (such as chemistry, electronics, or crafting). 
# Coordinators shall be appointed annually by the board of directors and serve at their pleasure.
##While wardens are responsible for organizing a zone to encourage cleanliness, organization and safety, individuals are ultimately responsible for their own safety (see [[#Safety|3.1 - 3.5]]). 
##Coordinators have final say in governing their zone and are responsible for making their rules known to members and guests. 
##Zones may have multiple wardens as long as those wardens act in agreement as one. 
##Members may be warden to multiple zones. 
##The Board of Directors will by default act as warden to any zones without volunteer wardens.

#The Floor Plan may only be changed with the approval of the Board of Directors.

#Access credentials may be temporarily entrusted to another person (trustee) for limited purposes, such as picking up or dropping off items or people at the space. 
#Such trustees are not considered members and are not allowed to use tools, host guests, store their personal property at i3Detroit, or exercise other benefits of membership simply for possessing access. 
#Sharing or loaning access outside these limits is grounds for revocation.
